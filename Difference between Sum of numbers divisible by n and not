// Java program to find the Difference between the Sum of numbers divisible by N and sum of numbers not divisible by N form 1 to M.

package differenceofsumdivisiblebyn;
public class DifferenceOfSumDivisibleByN {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n=4,m=20;
        int sum=0,sum1=0;int diff;
        for(int i=0;i<=m;i++){
            if(i%n==0)
                sum+=i;
            else
                sum1+=i;
        }
        diff=Math.abs(sum1-sum);
        System.out.println("Difference between the sum is "+diff);
    }
    
}

OUTPUT:

Difference between the sum is 90
